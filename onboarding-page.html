<h2>Allow ALL_URLS?</h2>
<p>In MV3 - Host permissions are (or will be) optional by default (when installed form the web store)</p>
<p>As this is dev mode this button will not do anything.
As I already have the permission.
To simulate the web store experience I will first disable then return to this page</p>
<button>Allow Access to ALL_URLS?</button>
